## Complied joern
we provide a compiled version of joern [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7323504#.Y3OQL3ZByUk).

To use this version of joern to parse the function:

  &nbsp; -- put each function per c file;

  &nbsp; -- start form ```AMPLE/data_processing/process.py```

After parsing the functions, use ```AMPLE/data_processing/word2vec.py``` for training the word2vec model. We also provide our trained word2vec model [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7333062#.Y3c5SHZByUk)

For constructing and simplifying the code structure graphs, start from ```AMPLE/data_processing/cpg_(original/TGS/VGS/GS).py```.
